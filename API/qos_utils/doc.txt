The bw unit is based on 'kbps'(kilo bit per second)

all LANs egress traffic --> ifb0
default class id --> 9999
mark of interfaces in mangle --> interfaces id (in database) marking interface is done in updating interface and in watcher
ifb interface bandwidth --> we consider a very big number () for ifb bandwidth. we use what admin enter as bandwidth for validating policies.

Design:
 -Interface config:
    Two things are requierd and should enter in Interface config section:
    1. Interface estimated upload and download BW)
    2. Type of interface (WAN or LAN)
