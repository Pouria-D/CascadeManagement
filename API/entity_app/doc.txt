VPN:
problem: some vpn params are save by the value of objects and becouse of this when object updates the vpn does not!!
this params are:
    -local-endpoint
    -remote-endpoint
    -real-local-endpoint
    -virtual-local-endpoint
    -real-remote-endpoint
    --virtul-remote-endpoint
if and address value is equal to one of this params, and the admin want to update this value to another type that is not
acceptable for vpn (mac, fqdn or network range) we raise error that you can't change this value.
