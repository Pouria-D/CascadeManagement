The network is working on some rules:
1. Adding unknown interfaces in API's db (This is done in watcher in set_system_interface)
2. Check each interface configuration and apply changes if there is some unset configs (This is done in watcher too...)
3. In main function (config_network_interface) the following steps will comes for each network interface:
    a. Check if the network interface is default gateway!
    b. Check the connection name, related to this network interface.
    Note: Important note here is the name of connection must be <interface_name>_con e.g. ETH0_con
    c. Change the connection name if it does not follow the above rule.
    d. Change the connection base on the following algorithm:
                            Is there any relate connection to this network?

 Add connection with new parameters

       Finish

    Note: The modify connection does not work in some cases! (may be a bug in network interfaces), so we delete and add
    a connection to modify it.
    e. Change the route table if the interface should be the default gateway.
    f. Down/Up the connection if there is some changes.

We have two important concepts in nmcli (Network-Manager)
1. Device:
    The real interface names in system.
2. Connections:
    The nmcli connections that are connected to a real Device in system.

From Device, we can know the current state of a real interface. e.g. The real state of a connection (for example 30 that
means disconnected). The complete reference for these states is in
https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nm-dbus-types.html#NMDeviceState
Some of important states are this:
NM_DEVICE_STATE_UNAVAILABLE     =   20  the device is managed by NetworkManager, but is not available for use.
    Reasons may include the wireless switched off, missing firmware, no ethernet carrier,
    missing supplicant or modem manager, etc. (Usually Cable is not connected)
NM_DEVICE_STATE_IP_CONFIG       =   70  the device is requesting IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses and routing information
    from the network. (Usually Trying to get ip address from DHCP)
NM_DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVATED       =   100 the device has a network connection, either local or global. (Usually everything
    is OK and the device is connected successfully and connected)
